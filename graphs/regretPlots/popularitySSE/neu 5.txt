count not cast this to a string The problem involves rounding the final result to the nearest whole number since the context implies counting flowers, which must be a whole number.)
count not cast this to a string 2

The text mentions that Mark has \(2x + y\) flowers in his garden. After simplifying the equation, it states "2xy = 0," which implies \(y = 0\) or \(x = 0\). However, this does not directly affect the expression \(2x + y\).

Given no specific values for \(x\) and \(y\) are provided after solving, but considering the algebraic setup and simplification, the final integer extracted from the context of \(2x + y\) is simply the coefficient 2.
