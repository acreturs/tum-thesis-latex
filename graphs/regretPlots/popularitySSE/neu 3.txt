count not cast this to a string James writes 108 pages annually.
   - This value directly answers the task's requirement for an integer representing the final calculated annual page count.

Therefore, the extracted integer, as per the provided context, is 108.
count not cast this to a string 0

The text does not contain any specific numerical calculations or mention of an explicit final calculated answer, so there is no integer to extract related to a calculation. The context describes the process and resources for website creation but does not include any quantifiable data that results in a final number. Therefore, based on the given information, the extracted integer representing a final calculated answer is 0.

count not cast this to a string Using these assumptions, an adjusted estimate of \( x = -120 \) is proposed as a feasible cost for the shoes, implying Alexis actually paid $120 for them (since the negative sign in the context of estimation suggests subtracting from a budget).

Thus, the final integer representing how much Alexis paid for the shoes, based on logical adjustment and constraints provided, is 120.
